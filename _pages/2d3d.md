# 2D to 3D Reconstruction

---
In neuroimaging research, 3D image data is the mainstay for representing anatomical details. However, in conventional clinical practice, pre- and post-natal assessments are performed with 2D video or static US images. The sonographers need to interpret the relationships between the 2D views and 3D brain anatomy and mentally reconstruct a 3D image given just the 2D information. Our goal is to develop methods to reconstruct a 3D brain scan from 2D freehand video acquisitions. We foresee that this would have applications in perinatal clinics, and in LMICs.
